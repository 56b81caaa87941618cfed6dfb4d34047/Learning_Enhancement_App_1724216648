Several of these features were marked as already in progress, such as the progress tracking dashboard and the ability to bookmark content. Additionally, another feature set was presented, emphasizing user feedback and notification systems, highlighting that while some features had been checked off, others required further attention. \n\nThe AI further engaged the user by asking specific questions regarding the form\u2019s functionality, such as whether it should be a pop-up or embedded within a page, and whether it should include a file upload option. The user\u2019s instructions were met with diligence, as the AI reiterated its commitment to fulfill these requirements, while also requesting more details about the project to better assist.",
